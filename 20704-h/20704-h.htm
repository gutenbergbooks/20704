<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

<p class="center">THE KEEPER.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>With an Excursus on Beaters.</i>)</p>

<p>Of the many varieties of keeper, I propose, at present, to consider
only the average sort of keeper, who looks after a shooting, comprising
partridges, pheasants, hares, and rabbits, in an English county. Now
it is to be observed that your ordinary keeper is not a conversational
animal. He has, as a rule, too much to do to waste time in unnecessary
talk. To begin with, he has to control his staff, the men
and boys who walk in line with you through the root-fields, or beat
the coverts for pheasants. That might seem at first sight to be an
easy business, but it is actually one of the most difficult in the world.
For thorough perverse stupidity, you will not easily match the
autochthonous beater. Watch him as he trudges along, slow, expressionless,
clod-resembling, lethargic, and say how you would like
to be the chief of such an army. He is always getting out of line,
pressing forward unduly, or hanging back too much, and the loud
voice of the keeper makes the woods resound with remonstrance,
entreaty, and blame, hurled at
his bovine head. After lunch, it
is true, the beater wakes up for
a little. Then shall you hear
<span class="sc">William</span> exchanging confidences
from one end of the line to the
other with <span class="sc">Jarge</span>, while the startled
pheasant rises too soon and goes
back, to the despair of the keeper
and the guns. Then, too, are heard
the shouts of laughter which greet
the appearance of a rabbit, and the
air is thick with the sticks that
the joyous, beery beaters fling at
the scurrying form of their hereditary
foe. It is marvellous to note
with what a venomous hatred the
beater regards the bunny. Pheasant
or partridge he is careless of;
even the hare is, in comparison, a
thing of nought, but let him once
set eyes on a rabbit, and his whole
being seems to change. His eye
absolutely flashes, his chest heaves
with excitement beneath the ancient
piece of sacking that protects
his form from thorns. If the rabbit
falls to the shot, he yells with
exultation; if it be missed, an expression
of morose and gloomy disappointment
settles on his face, as
who should say, "Things are played
out; the world is worthless!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/025.png"><img width="100%" src="images/025.png" alt="On their Beat." /></a><h3>On their Beat.</h3></div>

<p>All these characteristics are the
keeper's despair; though, to be
sure, he has staunch lieutenants in
his under-keepers; and towards
the end of the day he can always
count on two sympathising allies in
the postman and the policeman.
These two never fail to come out
in the afternoon to join the beaters.
It is amusing to watch the
demeanour of the beaters in the policeman's presence. Some of them,
it is possible, have been immeshed by the law, and have made the
constable's acquaintance in his professional capacity. Others are
conscious of undiscovered peccadilloes, or they feel that on some
future day they may be led to transgress rules, of which the policeman
is the sturdy embodiment. None of them is, therefore, quite at
his best in the policeman's presence. Their attitude may be
described as one of uneasy familiarity, bursting here and there into
jocular nervousness, but never quite attaining the rollicking point.
You may sometimes take advantage of this feeling to let off a joke
on a beater. Select a stout, plethoric one, and say to him, "Mind
you keep your eye on the policeman, or he'll poach a rabbit before
you can say knife." This simple inversion of probabilities and
positions is quite certain to "go." A hesitating smile will first
creep into the corners of the beater's eye. After an interval spent
in grappling with the jest, he will become purple, and finally he will
explode.</p>

<p>During the rest of the day you will hear him repeating your little
pleasantry either to himself or to his companions. You can keep it
up by saying now and then, "How many did the constable pocket
that last beat?" (<i>Shouts of laughter.</i>) Thus shall your reputation
as a humorist be established amongst the beating fraternity&mdash;("that
'ere Muster <span class="sc">Jackson</span>, 'e do make a chap laugh, that 'e do," is the
formula)&mdash;and if you revisit the same shooting next year, a beater is
sure to take an opportunity of saying to you, with a grin on his face,
"Policeman's a comin' out to-day, Sir; I'm a goin' to hev my eye
tight on 'im, so as 'e don't pocket no rabbits," to which you will
reply, "That's right, <span class="sc">George</span>, you stick to it, and you'll be a policeman
yourself some day," at which impossible anticipation there will
be fresh explosions of mirth. So easily pleased is the rustic mind,
so tenacious is the rustic memory.</p>

<p>But the head-keeper recks not of these things. All the anxiety
of the day is his. If, for one reason or another, he fails to show as
good a head of game as had been expected, he knows his master will
be displeased. If the beaters prove intractable, the birds go wrong,
but the burden of the host's disappointment falls on the keeper's
shoulders. His are all the petty worries, the little failures of the
day. The keeper is, therefore, not given to conversation. How
should he be, with all these responsibilities weighing upon him?
Few of those who shoot realise what the keeper has gone through to
provide the sport. Inclement nights spent in the open, untiring
vigilance by day and by night, a constant and patient care of his
birds during the worst seasons, short hours of sleep, and long hours
of tramping, such is the keeper's
life. And, after all, what a fine
fellow is a good keeper. In what
other race of men can you find in
a higher degree the best and manliest
qualities, unswerving fidelity,
dauntless courage, unflinching endurance
of hardship and fatigue,
and an upright honesty of conduct
and demeanour? I protest that
if ever the sport of game-shooting
is attacked, one powerful argument
in its favour may be found
in the fact that it produces such
men as these, and fosters their
staunch virtues. Think well of
all this, my young friend, and do
not vex the harassed keeper with
idle and frivolous remarks. But
you may permit yourself to say to
him, during the day, "That's a
nice dog of yours; works capitally."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," the keeper will say,
"he's not a bad 'un for a young
'un. Plenty of good blood in him.
His mother's old <i>Dido</i>. I've had
to leave her at home to-day, because
she's got a sore foot; but
her nose is something wonderful."</p>

<p>"Did you have much trouble
breaking him?"</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, Sir, no. He
took to it like a duck to the water.
Nothing comes amiss to him. You
stand there, Sir, and you'll get
some nice birds over you. They
mostly breaks this way."</p>

<p>That kind of conversation establishes
good relations, always an
important thing. Or you may
hint to him that he knows his
business better than the host, as
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must have been in the wrong place that last beat. Not a
single bird came near me."</p>

<p>"Of course you were, Sir. I knew how it would be. I wanted
you fifty yards higher up, but Mr. <span class="sc">Chalmers</span>, he would have you
here. Lor, I've never known birds break here. Now then, you boys,
stop that chattering, or I sends you all home. Seem to think they're
out here to enjoy theirselves, instead of doing as I tells 'em. Come,
rattle your sticks!"</p>

<p>Thus are the little beaters and the stops admonished.</p>

<h2>FROM A MODERN ENGLISH EXAMINATION-PAPER</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Which young Mr. D. Brown went in to floor, but which floored him.</i></p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is the meaning of "to deodorise." Give the
derivation.</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> "To deodorise" is to gild the statue of a heathen deity.
Literally "to gild a god." This compound verb is derived from
"<i>Deus</i>," dative "<i>Deo</i>," and the Greek verb "&delta;&omega;&rho;&iota;&xi;&omega;, <i>i.e.</i> to gild."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is a "Manicure"? Give its derivation.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is another term for a Mad Doctor. Its derivation is obvious&mdash;"Maniac
Cure." The last syllable of the first word being omitted
for the sake of convenience in pronunciation.</p>

<p>(By Somnus and old Nox I fear 'twas <i>not</i>!)</p>
<p>Common-sense was extinguished, and Good Taste</p>
<p>Did wonder darkling on the verge of doom.</p>
<p>I saw a Monster, a malign, marine, </p>
<p>Mysterious, many-whorled, mug-lumbering Bogey,</p>
<p>Stretched (like Miltonian angels on the marl)</p>
<p>In league-long loops upon the billowy brine.</p>

<p>Thou spectral spook of many Silly Seasons,</p>

<p><span class="i8">Then, horror-thrilled, I gazed</span></p>

<p><span class="i8">She sat,</span></p>
<p>A spectral, scraggy, beet-nosed, ankle-less,</p>
<p>Obtrusive-panted, splay-foot, slattern-shape,</p>
<p>Of grim Medusa-faced Immodesty,</p>
<p>Caged cumbrously in a stiff, swaying, swollen,</p>

<p>Hideous, indecent, awkward!</p>

<p>This loathly <i>revenant</i>, revisiting</p>
<p>The glimpses of the moon. She shamed my sight,</p>
<p>And blocked my way, and marred my young men's art,</p>
<p>Twenty years syne and more. 'Twas CRINOLINA,</p>
<p>The long-abiding, happily banished horror</p>
<p>We hoped to see no more. <i>Shall</i> she return</p>
<p>To vex our souls, unsex our wives and daughters,</p>
<p>And spoil our pictures as she did of old?</p>
<p>Forbid it, womanhood and modesty!</p>
<p>And if <i>they</i> won't, let manhood and sound sense</p>
<p>Arise in wrath and warn the horror off,</p>
<p>Ere she effect a lodgment on the limbs</p>
<p>Of pretty girls, or clothe our matron's shapes</p>
<p>With shame as with a garment.</p>
<p><span class="i8">"Get thee gone!"</span></p>

<h2>THE HAYMARKET HYPATIA.</h2>

<p>That I never could struggle through <span class="sc">Charles Kingsley's</span> novel
<i>Hypatia</i>, is, as far as I am personally concerned, very much in
favour of my pronouncing an unbiassed opinion on the "<i>new
classical play</i>" ("Historical," if
you like, but not "classical," and
there is not the slightest chance of
its becoming a "classic") written
by <span class="sc">G. Stuart Ogilvie</span>, entitled
<i>Hypatia</i>, and "<i>founded on</i> <span class="sc">Kingsley's</span>
<i>celebrated Novel</i>," which
"celebrated Novel" is, for me at
least, not only "celebrated," but
"remarkable," as being one of the
very few works of fiction (excepting
always the majority of
<span class="sc">Kingsley's</span> works) completely baffling
my powers of endurance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/028b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/028b.png" alt="Cyrillus Fernandez Gladstonius Episcopus." /></a><p class="center">Cyrillus Fernandez Gladstonius Episcopus.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Stuart Ogilvie's</span> Drama
may be a clever adaptation of a
story difficult to adapt; but that
his play is powerfully dramatic,
even when it arrives at what, as I
conceive, was intended to be its
strongest dramatic situation in
the Second Scene of the Third
Act, no one but an <i>Umbra</i> (to be
"classical"), a sycophant, a
"creature," or a contentious noodle,
could possibly assert. Yet, as a
series of <i>tableaux vivants</i>, illustrating
scenes in the public and private
life of <i>Issachar</i> the Jew,&mdash;and
that Jew Mr. <span class="sc">Beerbohm Tree</span>, so
artistically made up as to be absolutely
unrecognisable by those
who know him best,&mdash;the action is
decidedly interesting up to the end
of the Third Act. After that, all
is tumult. The gay and seductive
<i>Orestes</i>, Prefect of Alexandria
(carefully played by Mr.
<span class="sc">Lewis Waller</span>) is slain, anyhow,
all higgledy-piggledy, by the Jew,
<i>Issachar</i>, whose seductive daughter <i>Ruth</i> (sweetly and gently
represented by Miss <span class="sc">Olga Brandon</span>) this gay <span class="sc">Lothario</span> of a
Prefect has contrived, not, apparently, with any great difficulty, to
lead astray, or, to put it
"classically," to seduce
from the narrow path of
such virtue as is common
alike to Pagan, Jew, and
Christian. As for handsome
<i>Hypatia</i> herself,
magnificent though Miss
<span class="sc">Julia Neilson</span> be as a
classic model for a painter,
she is nowhere, dramatically,
in the piece, when
contrasted with the unhappy
Jewish Family of
two. It is the story of
<i>Issachar</i>, his daughter and
<i>Orestes</i>, that absorbs the
interest; and, as to what
becomes of <i>Cyril</i> and his
Merry Monks, of <i>Philammon</i>
(which, when pronounced,
sounds like a
modern Cockney-rendering
of <span class="sc">Philip Hammond</span>, with
the aspirate omitted and
the final "d" dropped), of
old <i>Theon</i> (who never
appears but he is immediately
sent away again, and
therefore might be termed
"<i>The-on-and-off-'un</i>"),
and, finally, of even that
charming specimen of a Girton
Girl-Lecturer on Philosophy
<i>Hypatia</i> herself, well&mdash;to
adopt <span class="sc">Hood's</span> couplet
about the Poor in London,&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/028c.png"><img width="100%" src="images/028c.png" alt="Cyrillus Fernandez Gladstonius Episcopus." /></a><p class="center">From an Ancient Vase found in the Haymarket.]</p></div>


<blockquote><p>"Where they goes, or how they fares, Nobody knows and nobody cares."</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire interest is centred in <i>Issachar</i>, and had the author
devised some strong dramatic climax (such as occurs in that play of
<span class="sc">Sardou's</span> where <span class="sc">Sarah B</span>. stabs <span class="sc">Paul Berton</span>) with which to finish
the piece, when the Prefect should have been killed either by
<i>Issachar</i> or by <i>Miriam</i> (<span class="sc">Sardou</span> would have made <i>Issachar's</i>
daughter the heroine&mdash;the <span class="sc">Sara Bernhardt</span>
of the piece) then, in the penultimate
Act, anything tragic, or otherwise, might
picturesquely and appropriately have happened
to the classic Girton girl, <i>Hypatia</i>, and
Master <i>Phil 'Ammon</i>,
the good young
Monk so inclined to
go wrong, to the
great contentment
of the audience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Tree</span> makes
a thoroughly oriental type of
<i>Issachar</i>, and it is within an
ace of being a grand impersonation.
What that ace exactly is, it
is somewhat difficult to say, but
what <i>is</i> wanting is wanting in his
great scene with his daughter. If
the dramatist had given him such
another final chance as I have
already suggested, the character
might have been dramatically
perfected in Mr. <span class="sc">Tree's</span> hands.
As it is, both by author and actor it
is left "to be finished in our next."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Terry</span> is good as the amatory
Monk, and Miss <span class="sc">Julia Neilson</span>
is statuesquely graceful as
<i>Hypatia</i>. If I say "she is making
strides in her profession," I must
be taken to allude not to her vast
improvement histrionically, but to
the long steps which she takes
across the stage.</p>

<p>The costumes are admirable,
especially that of <i>Issachar</i>, on
whose attire the Messrs. <span class="sc">Nathan</span>
as Israel-lights-and-leaders must
be considered high authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Alma Tadema, R.A.</span>, is responsible for the designs of the
scenery by Messrs. <span class="sc">Johnstone, Hann, Hall</span>, and <span class="sc">Harker</span>. [Great
chance for '<span class="sc">Arry</span> 'ere! "Scenery by '<span class="sc">Ann</span>&mdash;a lady artist of course&mdash;then
'<span class="sc">All</span> and then '<span class="sc">Arker</span>, from designs by <span class="sc">Halma Tadema</span>." "I
s'pose <span class="sc">Halma's</span> a artistic shemale," '<span class="sc">Arry</span> would say: "cos I know
as there's another <span class="sc">Halma</span> on the stage, leastways on the Music 'All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
stage, and she's <span class="sc">Halma Stanley</span>."]
Whatever the designing <span class="sc">Alma</span>
may have done, I cannot say
much for the reproduction of his
favourite game of marbles. The
"marble halls" lack polish; but
the Market Place, The Court of
<i>Hypatia's</i> House, <i>Issachar's</i>
snuggery, and a Street in Alexandria,
are highly effective pictures.
But I should like to know
if in Mr. <span class="sc">Alma Tadema</span>'s design
for the Monk's dress, Mr. <span class="sc">Fred
Terry</span> found a small black and
silver crucifix of very modern
workmanship suspended from the
girdle, as this religious emblem
did not come into use until a
much later date. By the way,
ecclesiastical ornaments must
have been cheap in those days to
warrant <i>Bishop Cyril</i> (strongly
rendered by Mr. <span class="sc">Fernandez</span>)
flaunting about the streets of
Alexandria in such rainbow
robes as, in a later age, would
have led people to imagine that
he had just broken out of the
stained glass window of a Gothic
Cathedral. Two thousand years
hence the New Zealand dramatist
may represent the Archbishop of
<span class="sc">Canterbury</span> as walking about
London in his lawn sleeves with
coronation cope and mitre, or
Cardinal <span class="sc">Herbert Vaughan</span>
as wearing his scarlet hat and
robes, and riding in a Hansom
cab, having been unable to pick
up his own Cardinal's train. All
this were hypercriticism, but that
the name of <span class="sc">Alma Tadema, R.A.</span>, is a public guarantee for
academical accuracy.</p>

<p>Anyhow, <i>Hypatia</i>, if not "a famous victory"&mdash;is at least a fine
spectacle, with some fine acting in it, but this is mainly confined
to Mr. <span class="sc">Beerbohm Tree</span>. As the very heavy father, Mr. <span class="sc">Kemble</span>
has not been allowed half a chance. Why should he not alternate
characters with Mr. <span class="sc">Fernandez</span>, and for three nights a week
appear as <i>Cyril</i> the Bishop, while <span class="sc">Fernandez</span> would be <i>Hypatia's</i>
parent who has to grovel on the steps while his highly educated
child is lecturing, who has to comfort her in her terror, and be
turned out neck and crop whenever nobody on the scene wants him,
which by the way, happens rather frequently.</p>

<p>The music to a Drama is generally a minor affair, but, in this
instance, it is both major and minor, and has been specially written
for the piece by Dr. <span class="sc">Hubert Parry</span>. As this play is not an "adaptation
from the French," the music of this Composer is the only <i>article
de Parry</i> about the piece, and, being strikingly appropriate, it
proves an attraction of itself. It is conducted by the Wagnerian
<span class="sc">Armbruster</span>, who, with his Merry Men, is hidden away under the
stage, much as was the Ghost of <i>Hamlet's</i> father whom <i>Hamlet</i>
irreverently styled "Old Truepenny." Altogether a notable piece.
<i>Prosit!</i></p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>The one volume entitled <i>My Flirtations</i>, written by <span class="sc">Margaret
Wynman</span> (so like a real name!), and published by Messrs. <span class="sc">Chatto
and Windus</span>, consists of short stories setting forth the varied
experiences of an uncommonly 'cute young lady. It is a literary
portfolio of lively sketches of men and women, "their tricks and
their manners," all most amusing, and told in a naturally easy and
epigrammatic style. Some of the characters are evidently intended
for portraits, which anyone living in the London world could
easily label&mdash;(which by changing "a" into "i" would be the probable
consequence)&mdash;were he not baffled by the art of the skilful
writer, and by the equally skilful illustrator&mdash;our Mr. <span class="sc">Partridge</span>&mdash;who
have, the pair of them, combined to throw the reader off the
right scent. The one mistake&mdash;not a fatal error, however,&mdash;which
this authoress has made, is that of getting herself engaged in the
last story. Not married, fortunately; only engaged. Consequently
the match can be broken off. Let her be "engaged" on another
volume. She can be married at the end of volume three, and may
give us her experiences as the wife of Mr. Whoever-it-may-be.
Will the clever authoress accept this well-meant hint from her
literary and critical admirer, <span class="sc">The Gallant Baron de B.-W.</span>?</p>

<h2>ROBERT WITH THE CHILDREN AT GILDHALL.</h2>

<p>Well, I don't quite kno as I quite hunderstans what's bin a
goin on in our old Sacred Gildall, or weather it's all xactly what
sum of our werry sollemest Holldermen, or ewen our werry anshent
Depputys, might admire; but I must say, for myself, that too
thowsand more owdashus boys, and larfing gals, I never seed nor
herd than I did on Toosday larst, for about fore hours, in old
Gildall aforesaid!</p>

<p>Jest to show how the werry best, aye and the werry wisest on
us, gets carried away by the site of swarms of appy children
a enjoying thereselves, as praps they never did afore, I feels
myself compelled to state, that our good kind Lord <span class="sc">Mare</span> was so
delighted to see sich swarms of appy children all round him and
looking up to him so appy and so grateful, that, jest afore it was
time to go, he acshally told 'em a most wunderful story all about
two great Giants as lived in the rain of King <span class="sc">Lud</span>, on Ludgate Hill.
I was that estonished when he begun, as to amost think that <span class="sc">Gog</span>
and <span class="sc">Magog</span>, as stood on both sides of him, would begin to grin, but
that was, of course, only a passing delushun. But didn't all the
children lissen with open mouths when the Lord <span class="sc">Mare</span> told 'em that
one of the Giants had too heads, and the other three! and that a
very good boy named <span class="sc">Jack</span> managed to kill 'em both!</p>

<p>And so all was ended but the cheering, and that the pore delited
children kept up till they all marched out, smiling and
appy, and wishing as such glorious heavenings was in store for
them in grand old Gildall for many, many years to come, and
with sitch a Lord Mare to see as everything was done as it had been
done that jolly heavening.</p>

Rhubarb-green and gilt paper, with dark olive dado:
curtains of a nondescript brown. Black marble clock on
grey granite mantelpiece; Landseer engravings; tall book-case,
containing volumes of "The Quiver," "Mission-Work in
Mesopotamia," a cheap Encyclopedia, and the "Popular

Mr. <span class="sc">Montague Tidmarsh</span>
<i>is leaving to
catch his omnibus</i>.
Mrs. T. <i>is at her
Davenport in the
window</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> (<i>from the door</i>).
Anything else you want
me to do, <span class="sc">Maria</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Don't forget
the turbot&mdash;and mind you
choose it yourself&mdash;and
the lobster for the sauce&mdash;oh,
and look in at <span class="sc">Seakale's</span>
as you pass, and
remind him to be here
punctually at seven, to
help <span class="sc">Jane</span> with the table,
and say I insist on his
waiting in <i>clean</i> white
gloves; and be home early
yourself, and&mdash;there, if he
hasn't rushed off before I
remembered half&mdash;&mdash;(Mr.
T. <i>re-appears at the door</i>.)
What is it <i>now</i>, <span class="sc">Montague</span>?
I do wish you'd
start, and have done with
it, instead of keeping <span class="sc">Jane</span>
at the front door, when
she ought to be clearing
away breakfast!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Very sorry, my
love&mdash;I was just going,
when I met a Telegraph-boy
with this, for you, I
hope there's nothing
wrong with Uncle <span class="sc">Gabriel</span>,
I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Don't stand
there holding it&mdash;give it
to me. (<i>She opens it.</i>)
"Regret impossible dine
to-night&mdash;lost Great Aunt
very suddenly.&mdash;<span class="sc">Buckram</span>."
How provoking of
the man! And I particularly
wished him to
meet Uncle <span class="sc">Gabriel</span>, because
he is such a good
listener, and they would
be sure to get on together.
As if he hadn't all the
rest of the year to lose his
Aunt in!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> That's <span class="sc">Buckram</span>
all over. Never can
depend upon that fellow.
(<i>Gloomily.</i>) Now we shall
be thirteen at table!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Nonsense,
<span class="sc">Montague</span>&mdash;we <i>can't</i> be!
Let me see&mdash;Uncle
<span class="sc">Gabriel</span> and Aunt <span class="sc">Joanna</span>, two; the <span class="sc">Ditchwaters</span>, four; <span class="sc">Bodfishes</span>,
six; <span class="sc">Toomers</span>, eight; Miss <span class="sc">Bugle</span>, nine; Mr. <span class="sc">Poffley</span>,
ten; <span class="sc">Cecilia Flinders</span>, eleven, ourselves&mdash;we <i>are</i> thirteen!
And I know Uncle will refuse to sit down at all if he notices it;
and, anyway, it is sure to cast a gloom over the whole thing. We
<i>must</i> get somebody!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> Couldn't that Miss&mdash;what's her name? <span class="sc">Seaton</span>&mdash;dine,
for once?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> The idea, <span class="sc">Montague</span>! Then there would be one Lady
too many&mdash;if you can <i>call</i> a Governess a Lady, that is. And I do so

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I might wire to <span class="sc">Filleter</span> or <span class="sc">Makewayt</span>&mdash;but I rather
think they're both away, and it won't do to run any risk. Shall I
bring home <span class="sc">Sternstuhl</span> or <span class="sc">Federfuchs</span>? Very quiet, respectable
young fellows, and I could let one of 'em go off early to dress.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Thank you, <span class="sc">Montague</span>&mdash;but I won't have one of your
German clerks at <i>my</i> table&mdash;everyone would see what he was in a
minute. And he mightn't even have a dress-suit! Let me think ... <i>I</i>
know what we can do. <span class="sc">Blankley</span> supplies extra guests for parties
and things. I remember seeing it in the paper. We must hire a man
there. Go there at once, <span class="sc">Montague</span>, it's very little out of your way,
and tell them to be sure
and send a gentlemanly
person&mdash;he needn't talk
much, and he won't be
required to tell any anecdotes.
Make haste, say
they can put him down to
my deposit account.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I don't half like
the idea, <span class="sc">Maria</span>, but I
suppose it's the only thing
left. I'll go and see what
they can do for us.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I <i>know</i> he'll
make some muddle&mdash;I'd
better do it myself! (<i>She
rushes out into the passage.</i>)
<span class="sc">Jane</span>, is your
Master gone? Call him
back&mdash;there, I'll do it.
(<i>She calls after Mr. T.'s
retreating form from the
doorstep.</i>) <span class="sc">Montague</span>!
never mind about <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>.
<i>I</i>'ll see to it. Do
you hear?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s Voice</i> (<i>from
the corner</i>). All right, my
love, all right! I hear.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I must go
round before lunch. <span class="sc">Jane</span>,
send Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> to me
in the breakfast-room.
(<i>She goes back to her desk;
presently</i> Miss <span class="sc">Marjory
Seaton</span> <i>enters the room;
she is young and extremely
pretty, with an air of
dejected endurance</i>.) Oh,
Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, just copy
out these <i>menus</i> for me, in
your neatest writing, and
see that the French is all
right. You will have
plenty of time for it, as I
shall take Miss <span class="sc">Gwendolen</span>
out myself this morning.
By the way, I shall
expect you to appear in
the drawing-room this
evening before dinner. I
hope you have a suitable
frock?</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> I have a
black one with lace sleeves
and heliotrope <i>chiffon</i>, if
that will do&mdash;it was made
in Paris.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You are fortunate
to be able to command
such luxuries. All
<i>my</i> dresses are made in
the Grove.</p>

<p><i>Miss Seat.</i> (<i>biting her
lip</i>). Mine was made when we&mdash;before I&mdash;&mdash;      [<i>She checks herself.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You need not remind me <i>quite</i> so often that your circumstances
were formerly different, Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span>, for I am perfectly
aware of the fact. Otherwise, I should not feel justified in bringing
you in contact, even for so short a time, with my relations and
friends, who are <i>most</i> particular. I think that is all I wanted you
for at present. Stop, you are forgetting the <i>menus</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Miss <span class="sc">Seaton</span> <i>collects the cards and goes out with compressed lips
as</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>enters</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Another telegram, if you please, M'm, and Cook would like
to speak to you about the pheasants.

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, dear me, <span class="sc">Jane</span>! I wish you
wouldn't come and startle me with your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
horrid telegrams&mdash;there, give it to me.
(<i>Reading.</i>) "Wife down, violent influenza.
Must come without her, <span class="sc">Toomer</span>." (<i>Resentfully.</i>)
Again! and I <i>know</i> she's had it twice
since the spring&mdash;it's too tiresomely inconsid&mdash;no,
it isn't&mdash;it's the very best thing
she could do. Now we shall be only twelve,
and I needn't order that man from <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>,
after all. Poor dear woman, I must
really write her a nice sympathetic little note&mdash;so
<i>fortunate</i>!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene</span> II.&mdash;Mrs. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh's</span> <i>Bedroom&mdash;Time
7:15.</i> Mrs. T. <i>has just had her
hair dressed by her Maid</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You might have given me more
of a fringe than that, <span class="sc">Pinnifer</span>. You don't
make nearly so much of my hair as you used
to! (<span class="sc">Pinnifer</span> <i>discreetly suppress the obvious
retort</i>.) Well, I suppose that must do.
I shan't require you any more. Go down and
see if the lamps in the drawing-room are
smelling. (<span class="sc">Pinnifer</span> <i>goes; sounds of ablutions
are heard from</i> Mr. T.'s <i>dressing-room</i>.)
<span class="sc">Montague</span>, is that you? I never heard you
come in.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s Voice</i> (<i>indistinctly.</i>) Only just
this moment come up, my dear. Been putting
out the wine.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You always <i>will</i> leave everything
to the last. No, don't come in. What?
How can I hear what you say when you keep
on splashing and spluttering like that?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s Voice</i> (<i>from beneath a towel.</i>)
That dozen of Champagne Uncle <span class="sc">Gabriel</span>
sent has run lower than I thought&mdash;only two
bottles and a pint left. And he can't drink
that <i>Saumur</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Two bottles and a half ought to
be ample, if <span class="sc">Seakale</span> manages properly&mdash;among
twelve.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s V.</i> Twelve, my love? you mean
<i>fourteen</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I mean nothing of the sort.
Mrs. <span class="sc">Toomer's</span> got influenza again&mdash;luckily,
so of course we shall be just twelve.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s V.</i> <span class="sc">Maria</span>, why didn't you tell
me that before? Because I say, look here!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He half opens the door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I won't have you coming in here
all over soap, there's nothing to get excited
about. Twelve's a very convenient number.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s V.</i> Twelve! Yes&mdash;but how about
that fellow you told me to order from <span class="sc">Blankley's</span>?
He'll be the thirteenth!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> <span class="sc">Montague</span>, <i>don't</i> say you went
and ordered him, after I expressly said you
were not to mind, and that I would see about
it myself! You heard me call after you from
the front door?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s V.</i> I&mdash;I understood you to say
that I was to mind and see to it myself; and
so I went there the very first thing. The
Manager assured me he would send us a
person accustomed to the best society, who
would give every satisfaction. <i>I</i> couldn't
be expected to know you had changed your
mind!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> How <i>could</i> you be so idiotic! We
simply can't sit down thirteen. Uncle will
think we did it on purpose to shorten his life,
<span class="sc">Montague</span>, do something&mdash;write, and put
him off, quick&mdash;do you hear?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.'s V.</i> (<i>plaintively</i>). My love, I <i>can't</i>
write while I'm like this&mdash;and I've no pen
and ink in here, either!</p>

<p><i>Jane</i> (<i>outside</i>). Please, Sir, <span class="sc">Seakale</span> would
like a word with you about the Sherry you
put out&mdash;it don't seem to ta&mdash;smell quite
right to him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Oh, never mind Sherry <i>now</i>.
(<i>She scribbles on a leaf from her pocket-book.</i>)
Here, <span class="sc">Jane</span>, tell <span class="sc">Seakale</span> to run with this to
<span class="sc">Blankley's</span>&mdash;quick.... There, <span class="sc">Montague</span>
I've written to <span class="sc">Blankley's</span> not to send the man&mdash;they're sure to keep that sort of person
on the premises; so, if <span class="sc">Seakale</span> gets there before they close, it will be all right.... Oh,
don't worry so.... What? White ties! How should <i>I</i> know where they are? You
should speak to <span class="sc">Jane</span>. And do, for goodness sake, make haste! <i>I'm</i> going down.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> (<i>alone</i>). <span class="sc">Maria</span>! hi.... She's gone&mdash;and she never told me what I'm to do if
this confounded fellow turns up, after all! Hang it, I must have a tie somewhere!</p>

<h2>THE RAILWAY SERVANT'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>For Use in the Training School when the proposed Institution has been established.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What are the duties of a Porter?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> To move passengers' luggage with the greatest possible expedition.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there any exception to that general rule?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, when the passenger is late, and there seems some doubt about the bestowal of a tip.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How would he inform passengers that they have to change carriages for, say,
Felstead, Margate, Highgate, Winchester and Scarborough.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By shouting, in one word, "Change-Felgit-Highchester-and-Boro!"</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If he had to call a Cab for an elderly Lady with three boxes, or a military-looking
Gentleman with an umbrella, which passenger would first claim his attention?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why, of course, the Captain.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the customary charge of a Guard for reserving a compartment?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A shilling for closing one of the doors, half-a-crown for locking both.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are the duties of a Booking-Clerk?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If very busy, a Booking-Clerk may walk leisurely from one pigeon-hole to the
other, and ask the passenger to repeat his demand, and then take some time in finding
the required amount of change. If the passenger is irritable, and in a hurry, the Clerk
can stop to explain, and remonstrate. In the case of an inquiry as to the progress of the
trains, a busy Booking-Clerk can refer impatient passengers to the time-table hanging
outside the station.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> When is a Booking-Clerk usually very busy?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> When he happens to be in a bad temper.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Ought a suggestion from the Public that the Public will write to his superiors have
any effect upon a Booking-Clerk?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not if the Public has just taken an express ticket in London either for Melbourne,
Australia, or Timbuctoo.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the best course for the Public to pursue under such circumstances?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To bear it either with or without a grin.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there much point about a Pointsman?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not after he has been on duty some eighteen hours.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And does his application of the break suggest anything?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, a break in this catechism. More on a future occasion.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">A Suggestion for Pantomime.</span>&mdash;The good Fairy, Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>, triumphing over
Evil Spirits, King Fog, Frost ("he's a nipper, he is!"), and Slush, the obstructionists.
Evil Spirits disappear, Good Spirits prevail, and, as <i>Kate Nickleby's</i> lunatic lover observed,
"All is gas and gaiters!" Messrs. <span class="sc">Dan Leno</span> and <span class="sc">Campbell</span> are doing great business just
now. <i>Vive</i> <span class="sc">Druriolanus Pantomimicus Imperator</span>!</p>
